## Who knows is this guy?

I'm a 16 y old Python dev who's learning too many things at once (Java, C, C++, PHP, Machine Learning, many web frameworks + I don't even know...)  
In web development since March 2020, I have a descreate knowledge of HTML , CSS and Scss. Now I'm trying to get good with Javascript and jQuery.  

## What am I currently working on

At the moment I'm working as a freelancer by making websites using React.
I am even rebuilding [my website](https://github.com/RoysManfo/RMHub) using React, Typescript and SASS for frontend, firebase for hosting and supabase for the backend.

## Can we trust this guy? He probably doesn't know anything

Not gonna lie, __you're actually right__, but I've gained some experience with HTML and CSS and I've also mastered Python enough to start learning Django. Here's a 
table where you can see by yourself my coding skills.

Technology | Experience | What have I done with it
------------ | ------------ | ------------
Python | 2 years | Many Command Line based programs including my own shell and a password manager
HTML, CSS, JS | 3 years | [The site mentioned above](https://roysmanfohub.web.app) and more web apps including "my version of Twitter", a roll machine game, a password generator and some templates for landing pages
C++ | 1 year | I created a simulation of a virtual world where people fight, make children and die (naturaly or becouse of a desease)
