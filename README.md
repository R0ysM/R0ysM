### Who knows is this guy?

I'm a 15 y old Python dev how's learning too many things at once (How to program in: Java, C, C++, PHP, I don't even know...)  
In web development since March 2020, I have a descreate knowledge of HTML , CSS and Saas. Now I'm trying to get good with Javascript and jQuery.  

## What am I currently working on

At the moment I'm creating my own portfolio website with Django and Firebase.
When it will be released I will make avaible some of my past programs for the download.  
[An example of my incredible CSS skills](https://shopdeepsound.web.app), I know the download doesn't work

## Can we trust this guy? He probably doesn't know anything

Not gonna lie, __you're actually right__, but I've gained some experience with HTML and CSS and I'm also mastering Python enough to start learning Django.Here's a 
table where you can see by yourself.

Technology | Experience | What have I done with it
------------ | ------------ | ------------
Python | 1 1/2 years | Many CLI based programs including my own terminal
HTML, CSS, JS | 2 years | [The site mentioned above](https://shopdeepsound.web.app) and more web apps including my version of Twitter, a casino, a password generator, some templates for landing pages
